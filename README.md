# Countries of the World

This application displays the list Countries and some information about them.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Typescript
- TailwindCSS
- Vite

This project is a challenge from Frontendmentor.io. I built this project to practise using Typescript with React. One of the challenges I encountered when building this application was typing the API fields in the Countries data. I couldn't get the correct type for every field of the data. So, I connected the data to my state and used it to correct the shape (type / interface) I created at the beginning. At the end of this project, I was more comfortable in using Typescript with react.
